==GOALS==
- to collect in one research knowledge and experience of FP programmers as set of design and integration patterns
- to try to apply mathematical theory to the most "mathematical" programming paradigm with aim to create common templates/design solutions
- to analyse ready patterns's performance. Functional code optimisation
- functional code refactoring using patterns
- comparison of resulted patterns with ones from ObjectOriented paradigm

- examples: Erlang
- printable version: LaTeX
